## Rushi Sharma
### Sprint 1 -
- **What tasks did I work on / complete?**
  I worked on the search component which we will use on the landing page where users can enter journey information to view the list of flights that match the specifications.
- **What am I planning to work on next?**
  Next, I am planning to work on that flight’s list page that will display the flights as per the information entered by the user on the landing page.
- **What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**
  None.
- **XP Core Value:**
  Communication because Esha and I communicated constantly while working on the frontend components and thus resolving any issues quickly.

### Sprint 2 -
- **What tasks did I work on / complete?**
  I worked on the flight list page that displays the flights as per the information entered by the user on the landing page. At this moment, we do not have a link with the database so currently, it displays random static data.
- **What am I planning to work on next?**
  Next, I am planning to work on an intermediary page that allows the user to either view as guest or login. Another page that I plan to start is the payment page where users enter their credit card info or mileage membership to reserve a flight seat.
- **What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**
  None.
- **XP Core Value:**
  Communication because Esha and I continued constant communication and also worked together performing pair programming.

### Sprint 3 -
- **What tasks did I work on / complete?**
  I started working on the transition page that allows the customer to either view the flights or login and goes ahead with the seat selection.
- **What am I planning to work on next?**
  Next, I plan on finishing the transition page as well as looking into adding that transition logic to the flight lists page itself and avoiding an entire page for the transition.
- **What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**
  None.
- **XP Core Value:**
  Feedback, as I reached out to my teammates for their feedback and thus received the suggestion of simplifying the transition logic.

### Sprint 4 -
- **What tasks did I work on / complete?**
  I created the payment age where users enter their credit card info to reserve a flight seat. I have started working on removing the transition page and adding the logic to the flight list page itself.
- **What am I planning to work on next?**
  I plan on finishing the logic for different user accesses for flight selection. I also plan to make the flight list page dynamic by creating a separate function to get the flight data from the backend.
- **What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**
 Connection with the backend.
- **XP Core Value:**
  Simplicity because I am working on making the flow of reserving a flight in lesser steps and removing pages that are not necessary.

### Sprint 5 -
- **What tasks did I work on / complete?**
  The logic has been added to allow different accesses for flight selection or viewing. The function to get flight data is created. The flight list page is dynamic after connecting with the database and performing API calls.
- **What am I planning to work on next?**
  I plan on looking into adding the logic to fetch the data after a search and viewing the flight data without creating a separate function for it.
- **What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**
 None
- **XP Core Value:**
  Feedback, as I was constantly receiving feedback from my peers and improving my approach eash time as they had more experience with making pages dynamic and connecting with the database.
